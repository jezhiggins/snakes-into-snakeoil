<div class="paragraph"><p>Jez Higgins</p></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Hello everyone. I&#8217;m Jez. I&#8217;m part of the older whiter beardier programming demographic, which I do feel guilty about. But not, if I&#8217;m frank, guilty enough to change careers and make way for someone younger.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is the 9th time I&#8217;ve spoken at the ACCU Conference. That came as something a surprise when I counted back and realised, because I&#8217;m don&#8217;t consider myself to be an expert in anything at all, and I am sure as hell that I don&#8217;t have any particular wisdom to impart.  Nonetheless, I&#8217;m grateful for the chance to speak, and I&#8217;m delighted that everyone here has chosen to come along to hear me burble on for the next 90 minutes, especially over such stiff competition.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is the point, by the way, where it&#8217;s ok to leave if you&#8217;re starting to realise you&#8217;ve made a terrible mistake.  It&#8217;s entirely fine.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So anyway, on those previous eight occasions I had a think about what I might talk about, wrote a proposal, and sent it in.  Sometimes I didn&#8217;t think for very long - for the 2012 conference I didn&#8217;t even consider submitting until 35 minutes before the deadline and got the proposal in with 28 seconds to go.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Anyway, this year, for this conference, I thought about things a lot.  A hell of a lot. Not because I was worried that the subject might not be of interest, or because I wouldn&#8217;t have enought to talk about or anything like that.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>No, I gave it a lot of thought because &#8230;&#8203;</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="quoteblock"><blockquote><div class="paragraph"><p>Did I want my name associated on the internet with the words Blockchain and Cryptocurrency?</p></div></blockquote></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Well, not really, but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m can handle it. (Also old, white, bearded means i get a pass anyway.)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As you know, we in software, even more so than society at large, as absolute fools for fashion and for hype. Some technologies appear as out of nowhere - we all woke up one morning and NoSQL databases were on trend. Other things snowball, sometimes over years or even decades, until the hype cycle become some overwhelming it forces you to give it attention. Python is perhaps one example. Functional programming :) Growing since the 50s, now everywhere :)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Blockchain technology seems to me like a snowballer. Bitcoin, the primary force behind all this has been bubbling away there for years - there have been fits and starts perhaps - but over the past what two or three years, cryptocurrencies,blockchains, and distributed ledger technologies seem to have built to some kind of unignorable force.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Seem to.  Not <em>have built</em> into an unignorable force, but <em>seem to have built</em>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Hopefully, at the end of this session, we&#8217;ll know enough to all be able to happily ignore it.</p></div></aside></section>

<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>I got a couple of people to look over my proposal before I submitted it. They were generally positive, although one comment I got was <em>I wouldn&#8217;t ever go for such a click baity title</em>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Well, you know the old aphorism about presentations - tell&#8217;em what you&#8217;re gonna tell 'em, tell&#8217;em, tell&#8217;em what you&#8217;ve just told 'em? Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m gonna now tell you.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I didn&#8217;t want anybody coming along today think I was going to tell you how cryptocurrencies were the future of money, or if you just hodl long enough you&#8217;ll be driving a lambo, or how the blockchain is going to revolutionise Ubers, or any thing like that.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>First, I&#8217;m going to talk about what blockchains are.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Then, I&#8217;m going to talk about why they&#8217;re terrible.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It was all there in the title :)</p></div></aside></section>
<section id="_snakes_into_snake_oil_2" data-transition="none"><h2>Snakes Into Snake Oil</h2><aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>So, what is a blockchain?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Usually when we describe a solution to a problem, we at least attempt to outline the problem first.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Even if we just confine ourselves to Bitcoin, as it was the first cryptocurrency, and thus the cause of all this nonsense, it&#8217;s still rather difficult to know what problem it&#8217;s solving. Some people will tell you that one day we&#8217;ll all be using Bitcoin for all our purchases, from a cup of coffee to a Lamborghini. Other people will tell you that Bitcoin was only ever intended as a "store of value". Yet others will tell you it&#8217;s about "banking the unbanked", bringing modern-day financial services to developing countries or some other white-saviour bullshit.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>They all use on the same software though, so let&#8217;s use that look at what they do agree on.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/shape-of-the-chain.svg" alt="shape of the chain" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>They agree that this is what a blockchain looks like.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Data is organised into blocks, and those blocks are organised into a chain.  We call it a chain because once we accept a block onto the chain it&#8217;s fixed in place.  We can&#8217;t move it around - we can&#8217;t change its position or its contents.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I&#8217;ve already used the term 'blockchain' and I&#8217;ve mentioned 'distributed ledger technologies - DLTs'. The two terms are essentially synonyms. DLT sounds a bit more "enterprisey", but they mean pretty much the same thing.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The data in the blockchain is made up of transactions.  That&#8217;s transaction in the sense of a database transaction - it&#8217;s an atomic operation that either succeeds or doesn&#8217;t happen at all. It&#8217;s also, given that we&#8217;re usually talking about crypto-currencies, often a transaction in the sense that person A is given person B "money".</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So a block contains a load of transactions, the timestamp when it was created, and which block it is.  Because it knows which block it is, by definition it must know the block before.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is the general shape for all blockchains and cryptocurrencies, and then following section applies generally too. There are, as ever, one or two exceptions each time - it&#8217;s not worth going into those, except to note that they exist and that their main effect it to fuel "why suchandsuch is the crypto to watch" type articles.</p></div></aside></section>

<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Once we&#8217;ve gather up some data into a block, that block&#8217;s closed and we can&#8217;t add anything more to it, nor can we change any of the contents.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The only way to add further data it to include in a subsequently block.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We can see, pretty naturally then, that blockchains are append only.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/shape-of-the-chain.svg" alt="shape of the chain" /></div></div>

<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Each bit of data on the chain, each little blob here, isn&#8217;t just a little message saying "send some playMoney to the pizza shop", it&#8217;s a cryptographically signed little message saying "send some playMoney to the pizza shop".</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Your "user account" on a blockchain is usually referred to as your "address".  When you create your "address" on a blockchain, you&#8217;re actually generating a key-pair, and your address is just the public key of that pair.  This is the "crypto" of cryptocurrency.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When you send a transaction, you sign it with your public key.  Consequently we know who, or at least which address, wrote which bit of data when.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We can, therefore, track every transaction made by a particular address.  It also means we could, if we really wanted to, track what happens to every single coin in the system.</p></div></aside></section>

guarantees provenance</p></td><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">distributed database</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Blockchains and cryptocurrencies run as peer-to-peer networks. For each node in the network to function, it needs a copy of all the data.  If you were to open up your laptops right now and install a Bitcoin client, the first thing it would do after it had connected to the network was start downloading the all the blocks in the Bitcoin block.  (Please don&#8217;t - it will take weeks and achieve nothing.) However, each node needs a copy of the data, and so blockchains are distributed databases.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>They&#8217;re not very good distributed databases in some senses - the read speed is dreadful and the write speed just appalling - but they&#8217;re are definitely very, very distributed.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/shape-of-the-chain.svg" alt="shape of the chain" /></div></div>

guarantees provenance</p></td><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">distributed database<br />
no central authority</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Blockchains can do this - provide append only distributed database with provenance guarantees - without relying on a central authority. There is no one at the heart of the network saying "yep, that&#8217;s ok", "ooh no, don&#8217;t like the look of that one".</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Quite why this is the case is not, I&#8217;ll grant you, immediately apparent from this diagram but, please trust me, we&#8217;ll come to it in a bit.</p></div></aside></section>
<section id="_building_a_blockchain" data-transition="none"><h2>Building A Blockchain</h2><aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>So let&#8217;s build a blockchain.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/linked-list.svg" alt="linked list" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Let&#8217;s start with this, a singly-linked list.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Start at the head, traverse the pointers, add things onto the end. Easy-peasy.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Hmm - this looks a bit like the picture we just looked at.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>What if, instead of pointing forwards, we swap those pointers around so each element points to its predecessor.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/reverse-linked-list.svg" alt="reverse linked list" /></div></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li class="fragment"><p>the block before me is block 742</p></li><li class="fragment"><p>and its hash is 0x371291a&#8230;&#8203;</p></li></ul></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>There we go. That looks more like it, right?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Generally, of course, when we talk about a linked list, the list is in memory and the pointers are memory addresses.  I am here, I need to go to this memory address for the next element, and that will tell me the address of the next element, and so on.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On our blockchain, that&#8217;s not going to fly. We don&#8217;t have them in memory, instead we&#8217;re downloading chunks of data from internet randos. Could be anything.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Instead, we use a "hash pointer".  A hash pointer is a little data structure that points to where some information is stored somewhere, together with a hash value of that information.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So here, instead of a bare pointer (the block before me is block 742), we&#8217;d use a hash pointer (the before me is block 742 and its hash is 0x371291a&#8230;&#8203;.)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This immediately allows us to verify that information hasn&#8217;t been changed.  If I offer you block 742 and it doesn&#8217;t hash to proper value, we immediately know something&#8217;s amiss.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Is it clear why?</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/hash-linked-list.svg" alt="hash linked list" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>So there we are, we have our lovely tamper-proof chain of blocks, where each block contains the hash of its previous block (and, therefore, of all the blocks before that).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Plenty of room for our data, our transactions, to rattle around in there.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Let&#8217;s have a think about that.  Our data is a set of transactions - Alice pays Bob, Bob pays Charlie, and so on.  Whether we think about that as monetary transactions or as database transactions, I think we can agree, order is important.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We could use another list, I suppose, but, as I&#8217;ve already hinted, instead we use a tree.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/tree.svg" alt="tree" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>So here&#8217;s a lovely tree.  This is a poorly drawn binary tree, which like all computer sciences tree grows down from the root, but I&#8217;m sure you know what a nicely drawn one looks like :)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We start at the root node, which has a couple of pointers to the two subtrees underneath it, and they have two pointers to their subtrees and so on, until we hit the leaf nodes.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the same way as we applied them our our list, we&#8217;re going to apply the hash pointers to our tree as well.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/merkle-tree.svg" alt="merkle tree" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Suppose we have some lumps of data - these lumps are the leaves of our tree. We can organise the lumps in pairs, then for each pair we build a little data structure that has two hash pointers, one for each of the blocks. These data structures are the next level of the tree.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Then, like all good computer science problems, we recurse! We group the hash pairs into groups of two, and build another layer of hash pairs above that.  And so on and so on until we&#8217;re down to a single block, the root node of the tree.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This whole thing is a Merkle Tree, named for its inventor a chap called Ralph Merkle. A lifelong Californian Merkle studied at UC Berkley and then at Stanford in the 70s, was a cryptographer, developing an early example of public key cryptography while still a student, he actually invented cryptographic hashing, as well as these trees. More recently, he&#8217;s taken that turn into full-on California white man wacko, "researching" cryonics, nanotechnology, and working at Ray Kurtzweil&#8217;s Singularity University.  (Older audience members are probably more familiar with the work of his wife, Carol Shaw, who wrote Super Breakout and River Raid for the Atari 2600.)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the same way as the linked list, this makes the tree tamper proof.  If some of the data at the bottom gets jiggled around, the path of hashes to the root will fail.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The also gives us proof-of-membership.  If I present a piece of data, and the hashes of the path to the root, we can quickly establish if this bit of data does actually live in this tree.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/shape-of-the-chain.svg" alt="shape of the chain" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>These hash-pointer powered lists and trees help explain how this all organised and how we can be confident the data we have is untampered with.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, it does nothing to tell us how the data got into the tree in the first place, or how the blocks are created.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/bitcoin-coffee-prague.jpg" alt="bitcoin coffee prague" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>So, here I go, into my coffee shop with my cryptocurrency client under my arm to order up a disappointing coffee. The barista says "that&#8217;ll be some fraction of a bitcoin please, guvnor" and now it&#8217;s time! Time for me to send a transaction.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is a photo of a real place, by the way, Bitcoin Coffee in Prague, where the coffee is, apparently, very good, but you can only pay in Bitcoin.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I whip out my bitcoin client, laboriously type in the lengthy string of hex digits he gives as his address, unless he&#8217;s fully modern and has, I don&#8217;t know, a QR code for me to scan or something, enter the amount, and hit "SEND".  What happens now?</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/peer-to-peer-network.svg" alt="peer to peer network" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Blockchains operate as peer-to-peer networks. We&#8217;re perhaps most familiar with the idea of peer-to-peer networks from something like Bittorrent - a peer-to-peer network is something we grab data from, rather than write data too.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We have our peer-to-peer network - there are a number of nodes, and each node is talking to some, but not all all, of the other nodes. Everyone - every actual person - who&#8217;s interacting with the network is doing so through one of these nodes.</p></div></aside></section>

<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>The network is in the process of creating a new block. My node adds my transaction to its collection of "pending transactions".

<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>But I might not be the only person buying a decaff oat-milk latte with extra sprinkles.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As my transaction propagates through the network, other transactions are also travelling across it too.</p></div></aside></section>

<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>We&#8217;ve got other transactions coming onto the network, and the same thing happens to them. Nodes add them to their pool of pending transactions and send them on.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>And, of course, there are other transactions coming into the network all the time. They&#8217;re might also be new nodes coming into the network, or dropping out of the network.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>All the nodes here could be in a slightly different state - they might all have seen different transactions, all in a slightly different order.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/settle-down-everyone.svg" alt="settle down everyone" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>And suddenly!</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>One of the nodes says "I&#8217;ve got a new block!". We&#8217;ll come to how it decides that in just a moment. It says it to itself initially.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/new-block-propagation.svg" alt="new block propagation" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Then it starts to tell its peers.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>That block contains some of the pending transactions, but not all.  As this new block spreads across the network, the transactions that didn&#8217;t make it in get carried forwards into the successor block. And of course, there are new transactions coming in as well.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/competing-blocks.svg" alt="competing blocks" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>And while that block is spreading across the network, another node might also pipe up "I&#8217;ve got a block!".</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>And then this new block starts spreading across the network - both different, both claiming to be latest block.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As chaotic as it is, this is normal.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It&#8217;s entirely normal for there to multiple "latest" blocks in flight at once.  So, how do these nodes in the middle know what to do?</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/stable.svg" alt="stable" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Here&#8217;s the blockchain as seen by one of the nodes in the middle there.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We&#8217;ve got our nice new block and we waiting for/trying to create the next block.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Then one of our peers says "here&#8217;s a new block"</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/n-plus-1.svg" alt="n plus 1" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>So it says "great, I&#8217;ll just pop that on the end there".</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Then another of my peers says "hola! I&#8217;ve got that block N+1 we&#8217;ve been waiting for".</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>And I have a look at it, and it&#8217;s not what I&#8217;ve already got, it&#8217;s something a bit different.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/another-n-plus-1.svg" alt="another n plus 1" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>But that&#8217;s ok, I&#8217;ll just hang on to that too and get on with the business of trying to create a new block.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Some time later, one of my peers is going "psst! heard about that new block? N+2!", and I&#8217;m like "no way!" and they&#8217;re like "ikr"</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>And this N+2 arrives &#8230;&#8203;</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/another-n-plus-2.svg" alt="another n plus 2" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Because N+2 has a hash pointer to its predecessor, I know that it&#8217;s pointing back to, say, this red block here.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now, the red block looks more likely as the "real" N+1. I might see other potential N+1s, I might see other potential N+2s, so I have this little tree of possible futures.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If I manage to create a new block, I&#8217;m going to add it to the longest chain I know about it.  In this case here, I&#8217;d build my block on the grey block not the green one.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I as know more of what my peers have seen I get more and more confident about the "true" state of the chain. After a little while it&#8217;s going to become clear that we are adding new blocks on our grey block rather than though this green block.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>That tree of possibilities has pruned down, and the trunk is clear.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We&#8217;ve always got some uncertainty right at the head of the chain, but these little side shoots have withered away. The longest chain is the true chain, and that arises from the network. There&#8217;s no single node saying "that block, that block". Each block can operate autonomously, but the consensus arises from the network as a whole.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>One of the consequences of this is that there&#8217;s no guarantee of when, if ever, a particular transaction is incorporated into the chain.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now, there&#8217;s no hard and fast rule when you can stop thinking about this possibilities, but the general heuristic for BlockChain is 6 blocks. Once something&#8217;s six blocks old, we can regard it as done and dusted.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is how we extend the chain, but we still haven&#8217;t talked about how those nodes get to say they&#8217;ve created a new block.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/shape-of-a-block.svg" alt="shape of a block" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Here&#8217;s our in-progress block, that each node is trying to create.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We know what out block number is going to be.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We&#8217;re organising our transactions into our Merkle Tree at the bottom there,</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>But how do we know when we&#8217;ve actually created a new block?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There&#8217;s something else in our block here.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/magical.svg" alt="magical" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>It&#8217;s a magical random number.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>All the time, we&#8217;re calculating the hash of things - the branches of our Merkle tree in the data here, we calculate the hash our predecessor to verify it&#8217;s ok, and so on.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>And we calculate the hash of the new block we&#8217;re creating. If the hash we calculate has some particular property, say 6 leading zeros, we win! We&#8217;ve created a new block. But waiting for that happen just by arranging the transactions we&#8217;ve got might take a very long time. Indeed it might never happen. So, we add a little extra into the mix - a magical random number.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We gather our transactions into a tree, pick a random number, calculate the hash of the whole lot. Does it win? Does it have whatever characteristic we&#8217;re looking for? No. How sad. Quick, pick another number! Recalculate the hash. Get it this time? Another number, another hash. Quicker!</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Eventually someone, somewhere, will stumble on the right combination of transactions and magic number, and creates - <strong>mines</strong> - a new block.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Because of the opaque nature of the hash functions, it&#8217;s hard to find this magic number - hard in the sense that you have to spin through a lot numbers - but easy for everyone to verify.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/bitchair.jpg" alt="bitchair" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Guessing these numbers before anyone else is why people lash together ridiculous rigs like this.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You&#8217;d imagine that if the magic numbers, the nonces, were found more quickly, the blocks would start to be mined more quickly. This isn&#8217;t the case.  The "difficulty" is adjusted periodically - in BitCoin&#8217;s case every 2016 blocks, about one a fortnight - to maintain the desired average block time.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If we had a sudden influx of new nodes, all with outrageous compute power, all that would happen would be it would get more difficult to create new blocks.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It turns out that the particular hash function Bitcoin uses is very amenable to vectorisation so there was a genuine bubble for high-end GPUs for a while, and now people will sell you custom ASICs for it. Other crytocurrencies, learning from that experience, designed hash functions which are ASIC-resistant. The same general scheme applies though - adjust the difficulty to maintain the desired block rate.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Aside from the novelty of it, why would people spend the time and effort to build and maintain these rigs?</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="ulist"><ul><li class="fragment"><p>The Block Reward</p></li><li class="fragment"><p>Transaction Fees</p></li></ul></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>I&#8217;ve avoided saying the word "cryptocurrency" too often in this session, but now I&#8217;m going to have to.  We&#8217;re talking about a currency, or at least something that purports to be a currency, so we encourage people to run the nodes, to do this work, by "incentivising" them.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We pay them.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We pay them in two ways.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>The block reward</strong>. The node that creates a block get to include a special "coin creation" transaction in that block. This creates new Bitcoins out of nothing and credits them to an address, typically, of course, your own. The Bitcoin block rewards started at 50 bitcoin, but halves every 210,000 blocks and is now 12.5 bitcoins. It&#8217;ll eventually fall to zero (sometime in 2140), when all the bitcoins will be in existence.  Other cryptocurrencies have similar schemes.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The second incentive is the <strong>transaction fee</strong>. When I sent my transaction onto the network, I said pay my bearded barista how ever much. I can also then say "and have this for your trouble". This might make my transaction more attractive, in financial terms, than someone elses and so nodes might choose to incorporate it into a block ahead of some other transactions. The node that mines the block gets all the fees offered by the transactions.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/shape-of-the-chain.svg" alt="shape of the chain" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>That&#8217;s pretty much it - that&#8217;s how a blockchain based crytocurrency hangs together.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>By using hash pointers, both from one block to the next, and within the tree of transactions, we can provide guarantees about immutability and tamper-evidence. Because transactions are cryptographically signed, we can be sure about the origin of each one. And through this consensus mechanism, we can create a blockchain we all agree on in the absence of any central authority.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/bitcoin-logo.png" alt="bitcoin logo" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>I&#8217;ve referred, so far, pretty much exclusively to Bitcoin. It was the first cryptocurrency, so it&#8217;s the one most people have heard of, and it also set the template for what followed.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/bitcoin-and-others-logo.png" alt="bitcoin and others logo" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>There are now somewhere north of 2000 cryptocurrencies. Creating a new one is easy! By definition all this code needs to be open source, so you just grab that, tweak it a tiny bit and off you go.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/bitcoin-and-others-logo.png" alt="bitcoin and others logo" /></div></div>

<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Or just goto <a href="http://build-a-co.in" class="bare">http://build-a-co.in</a> and fill in a form.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Other cryptocurrencies are broadly similar.  Often, these other cryptocurrencies are attempting to correct some perceived flaw in BitCoin, or the flaw in the one that corrected the perceived flaw &#8230;&#8203;</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>That&#8217;s why some of these logos look similar to each other - they&#8217;re forks of each other.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>These other cryptocurrencies might differ in terms of block frequency - how often new blocks are created - or in block size - how much data we can stuff into one block - or in how block rewards are created. Some systems generate all the currency right up front, and just had it out.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>One area where there&#8217;s a lot of active work in the block creation mechanism.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="ulist"><ul><li class="fragment"><p>Proof-of-work</p></li><li class="fragment"><p>Proof-of-stake</p></li><li class="fragment"><p>Proof-of-authority</p></li></ul></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>The system I described a few moments ago is called proof-of-work. It achieves it&#8217;s aim, but it&#8217;s hugely wasteful.  In a proof-of-work system, the chance of you mining the new block are proportional to your <strong>hashpower</strong> compared to the hashpower of the whole network.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In a proof-of-stake network, you pay a stake for the chance to create a new block. You chance then become linked to the size of your stake. There&#8217;s an interesting bootstrapping problem here, of course, and you&#8217;d need protections to prevent the whole system getting hijacked, but it&#8217;s an active area of development.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Proof-of-authority doesn&#8217;t rely on either of these mechanisms. Instead, you define a limited number of nodes and say "one of you can mine the next block". Then you can turn the difficulty on your hash function right down.  Proof-of-authority flies in the face of the "no central authority" thing, but for many applications that probably not an issue and probably a benefit.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The other major way some of these platforms differ is in what can go into a transaction.</p></div></aside></section>

<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>One of the consistent themes of the talk so far is me holding back information to spring on you at a later point.  I&#8217;m going to do it again.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I&#8217;ve blithely talked about transactions saying person A sends some bitcoin to person B, and made it sound like that&#8217;s a little data structure or something. That&#8217;s not quite the case - the transaction is actually a little script.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Here&#8217;s an example - we&#8217;ve got a metadata header at the top - number in inputs, number of outputs, and the hash of the entire transaction.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Then we have the input section. An input specifies a previous transaction, so we have the hash of that transaction, and the index of the output we&#8217;re claiming.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Then we have the outputs - in this case only one although their can be many.  The output has a value, and the sum of the output has to be equal or less than the sum of the inputs. If it&#8217;s less, the difference is the transaction fee. Then there&#8217;s this weird line here - this is a BitCoin script.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The scripting language in Bitcoin is pretty basic - its not Turing complete, for instance - and it&#8217;s not clear to me that much is done with it beyond the send some money to person B.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This little bit of script here is saying, in effect, the output of this script can be redeemed by a public key that hashes to 69e02whatever, along with a value signature from the owner of that key".</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are two possible outcomes from one of these scripts - it works, in which case the transaction is valid - or it doesn&#8217;t, in which case it will be discarded.  There are about 160 opcodes in the Bitcoin script language, but these 4 in this order are the most common by far.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Some blockchains go beyond simple scripting into something much broader, into what we call smart contracts.  Ethereum is the probably best the known cryptocurrency example.  You might also have heard of Hyperledger Fabric.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="listingblock"><div class="content"><pre class="CodeRay"><code class="solidity language-solidity">  function store(string key, string payload)
                          external permittedOnly {
    bytes32 previous_key = moveExisting(key);
    bytes32 null_key;

    Payload storage newPayload = registry[key];
    newPayload.payload = payload;
    newPayload.previous_key = previous_key;

    if (previous_key == null_key)
      emit Registration(msg.sender, key, payload);
    else
      emit Update(msg.sender, key, payload);
  }</code></pre></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Now we all know that naming things in Computer Science is hard. However, in this particular case, the naming is deliberately obfuscatory. A smart contract is not smart, nor is it a contract. It&#8217;s a program you can deploy into your blockchain.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The programs expose various public methods, and calls to those methods can form one of the transactions encoded into each block. When your client downloads and validates a block, it runs any smart contract method calls in the block. So a smart contract is way of asking other people to perform computation on your behalf.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now this sounds like a one-way trip to Denial-of-service city. The mechanism to prevent that is, you&#8217;ll be unsurprised to learn, financial.  Each opcode has a cost associated with it, and to run the method your transaction is actually "call this method with these parameters and I will pay this amount".  If you don&#8217;t pay enough, it doesn&#8217;t run but you&#8217;ve spent it anyway. Ethereum also incorporates a computational limit on each block, so there&#8217;s an upper-bound on it.</p></div></aside></section>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The thing that stands out to me is the, weirdly, the essence of distrust that runs through it - person to person, can&#8217;t be frozen, no censorship, no third party interference, no banks.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>The "advantage" of cryptocurrencies is that there&#8217;s no central authority, no reversibility.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>That&#8217;s fundamentally at odds with our modern financial system, right? That relies on transaction reversibility to, for example, counteract fraud.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The video a moment ago said "go to an exchange, buy some BitCoin with your actually useful dollars or Euros or Yen". But wait a minute, do I have to trust these exchanges then?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Yes, you do.  But we&#8217;re so easy, so they exchanges - we&#8217;ll buy the cryptocurrency for you and we&#8217;ll store you wallet too.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/hacked-exchanges.png" alt="hacked exchanges" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>There have been at least 20 hacks of cryptocurrency exchanges. Approximately 7% of all Bitcoins have been stolen.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>One of the most famous is this one in the middle there - Mt Gox. It was hacked twice, once in 2011 and once in 2014. The 2014 hack had a purported dollar value of $460 million.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Do you know where the name MtGox comes from?  Magic The Gathering: Online Exchange. It was started as marketplace for Magic card trading, which ran for a few months in 2007. In 2010, Jed McCaleb read a Slashdot post about Bitcoin, tried to buy some and couldn&#8217;t, so thought an exchange would be a good idea. He slapped together something in PHP, reused the domain, and that was that.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In 2012, an exchange called Bitcoinica, run by a 17 year old kid, was hacked three times - March, May, and July.  The nominal dollar values were $228,000, $80,000, and $300,000.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Bitcoin proponents will say - yea but that was the exchanges - the ledger was secure - which is true but unhelpful. They&#8217;ll also say "yea, but banks get hacked" which is also true, but similarly unhelpful.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Quadriga CX was Canada&#8217;s largest crypto exchange. It&#8217;s not clear if it was hacked, but there&#8217;s certainly something going on. The founder apparently died, unexpectly, while on honeymoon in India. He was the only person with the passwords to the wallets. The wallets turned out to be empty. Approximately $160 million are missing.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There&#8217;s no regulation, no insurance, no nothing - you&#8217;re out my friend.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Ok, so let&#8217;s not use the exchanges. Assuming I have managed to get hold of some cryptocurrency somehow, I&#8217;ll keep my wallet nice and secure on my own device.</p></div></aside></section>

In some future where you were paid in cryptocurrency, perhaps by some smart contract, changing your wallet address could mean you don&#8217;t get paid. Ever.  (Unlike moving your account with one of those untrustworthy banks!)</p></div>

<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Somehow I&#8217;ve got some BitCoin, I&#8217;ve managed to keep it secure, but now it&#8217;s burning a hole in my pocket! Got to spend it! Got to spend them bitcoins.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>But where?  Here we are in Bristol - it&#8217;s busy, prosperous city - 8th or 9th biggest city economy in the country (Birmingham is second by the way, don&#8217;t let anyone from Manchester tell you otherwise) - there are over a million people in the metropolitan area. Lots of cool places to eat and drink, quite a lot of software and technology companies locally.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There is not a single place in Bristol that accepts cryptocurrency payments.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is not unique to Bristol. There are, to the first approximation, zero businesses that accept BitCoin or other cryptocurrencies. The minute number that do use a service like BitPay (yes, the same BitPay who&#8217;s wallet was compromised, oh and who&#8217;s CEO got phished and had his own wallet drained).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>What BitPay does is immediately convert the cryptocurrency payment back into dollars or whatever, and then pass that to the merchant. You probably used cash to by the BitCoin, which was immediately converted back into cash and our one transaction has turned into three. What was that about low fees again?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>But I really want to a cup of coffee, so I travel to this place in Prague. I order my coffee and I send my BitCoin payment. And I wait, and I wait. Eventually, the barista says "ok, you&#8217;re payment is confirmed on the chain, here&#8217;s your drink" and he gives me a stone cold cup of coffee.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Remember how consensus arises in the peer-to-peer network? To be confident a transaction is incorporated in the chain I need to wait for it be 6 blocks deep. Three is probably ok, but 6 to be confident. BitCoin generates a new block every 10 minutes. The coffee has been sitting at least half an hour. Ethereum generates a new block every 15 seconds, but even so 45 seconds is a significant delay in a retail setting.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Oh, and BitCoin has a maximum throughput of 7 transactions a second.  Visa processes about 150 million txs a day, which averages to 1700/sec.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Again, one or other of us has to trust the other. I pay, then collect my coffee later maybe, or he gives me my coffee and hope the transaction goes through. So much for a trustless system.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Well, what if I have a less time critical system - I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve all had work done, or have done work, that you&#8217;re billed for later right</p></div></aside></section>

In the intervening period the "value" of the lost harddrive has gone up to $80 million.  He had, apparently offered Newport Council £7.5 million to dig up this landfill.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If the everyday-shoppers are wrong, maybe the store-of-value people are right?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Let&#8217;s imagine - we&#8217;ve had to do a lot of imagining - he found that harddrive, and recovered that wallet.  Would he be sitting on $80 million worth of BitCoin?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>No, he wouldn&#8217;t. Instead he would be sitting on a £7.5 million bill from the council and a very small harddrive.</p></div>

<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>The overwhelming majority of crytpocurrency trading volumes are fake.  This is exchanges either outright lying about their trading volumes, or just swashing their own holdings back and forth in an attempt to move the market.  And they&#8217;re not swashing it between BitCoin and dollars.  They&#8217;re moving it between different cryptocurrencies. And, as we&#8217;ve already seen, cryptocurrencies are like standards. The nice thing about them is that you have so many to choose from. Furthermore, if you do not like any of them, you can just wait for next year&#8217;s model.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve dug up my harddrive, got my wallet, and now I want to liquidate my BitCoins into actual useable money.  We&#8217;ve know the valuations are hugely inflated, but it must be worth something to somebody right?  Well, no.  The market is so illiquid that a sell of this size would crash the price.  Almost nobody is using it - there is no economy.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>BitCoin is by far the biggest cryptocurrency - biggest in terms of public awareness, of active users, hashpower, however you want to manage it - which is why I&#8217;ve talked about it, but you might think maybe some of those other cryptocurrencies, they might sensible and legit right?</p></div></aside></section>

<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/bitcoin-miners.png" alt="bitcoin miners" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>BitCoin mining is highly centralised, and the situation is worse for less popular cryptocurrencies.  These are mining pools - people cooperating together to try and find that magic random number.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Estimates vary for the number of actual miners - I&#8217;ve seen figures from 5000 to 150,000 to 300,000 - but that doesn&#8217;t matter if they&#8217;re cooperating in pools. There is, though, general agreement that something like 75% of all mining capacity is based in China.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On Monday, China&#8217;s National Development and Reform Commission listed cryptocurrency mining as one of the industries it wants to "eliminate". It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what happens then. BitCoin maximalists are, bizarrely, saying this is why pool mining is a bad idea in the first place.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If any of these pools come to dominate the hashpower of a cryptocurrency, they can attack it. This is known as a 51% attack.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>BitCoinCash, newly beloved of our friend from Newport, was at risk at end of last year, several smaller cryptocurrencies have been subject to successful attacks. Even some of the larger ones are at risk. Ethereum Classic (an Ethereum fork) was successfully attacked in January.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>What does a 51% attack mean?</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/another-n-plus-2.svg" alt="another n plus 2" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Recall what&#8217;s going on when we building the state of the chain. We&#8217;re waiting for blocks to arrive so we can work out which ones are "real".  In my example, in normal operation, those blocks arrive attached near the tip. But they could arrive linked to anywhere in the past, even the deep past.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/ethereum-classic.png" alt="ethereum classic" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>In the Ethereum Classic attack, block reorganisation went 100 blocks deep. During the attack on BitCoinCash, people we advise to wait 50 blocks to confirm transactions. That&#8217;s nearly long enough for my coffee to not only have gone cold, but have completely evaporated.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Proof-of-work is not about securing the chain. It&#8217;s about preventing "sybil attacks" - someone spinning up a whole load of nodes to generate blocks faster than the rest of the network. By spinning away on these useless calculations, it&#8217;s intended to make it uneconomic for someone to do that. Which is fine, if you&#8217;re happy to burn approximately US$6 million a day to secure the network. If we just trusted each other, we could run these networks off that old Amiga in your attack.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A successful 51% attack allows the blockchain to be rewritten - to spend currency twice, to prevent transactions going through, to erase data. And to mount that attack I just need to throw compute power at it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There&#8217;s a website to let me do that.</p></div></aside></section>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Cryptocurrencies are founded in a strong libertarian ideology. This is why there&#8217;s this emphasis on person-to-person, the loudly stated distrust of 'central authorities'. Bound up in this is the idea that banks can 'steal your cash' just by printing more, so we have a digital version of the gold standard. There will, for example, be 21 million BitCoin and no more. There&#8217;s a reason the world abandoned the gold standard. There&#8217;s a reason people uses banks. People like reversibility! It actually increases trust!</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Those big mining pools come, ironically enough, from people trusting each other. Rather than a network of suspicious preppers all dug into their bunkers, there are people actually trusting each other! Woah!</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I could go on - I&#8217;ve ploughed through so much shit researching this - I had all these earlier incidents, but as I was writing this talk, new stuff just kept coming up - all these are recent examples, just from the last few days and weeks.

<div class="paragraph"><p>But serious corporations are involved in this blockchain business, so there must be something to it? Must be. Even IBM are getting aboard the blockchain, and nobody ever got fired for buying IBM, right?.</p></div></aside></section>

<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Here&#8217;s an news item from earlier this year. IBM and Pacific International Lines conducted a trial on a blockchain powered bill of lading. The bill of lading is the manifest of your goods being shipped, in this case 3000 cartons of mandarin oranges shipped from China to Singapore.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>"With the use of IBM Blockchain powered e-BL, the trial has produced a significant reduction in the administrative process of transferring the title deed from five to seven days to just one second, claimed the parties."</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This article goes on to talk about how it&#8217;s important fresh produce is moved quickly, and how you get cost savng because you don&#8217;t have to refridgerate it for so long, and all the rest of it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Does anyone else smell anything?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This five to seven days refers to paper based bills of lading, which nobody&#8217;s used for 30 years on account of them all being modern and electronic. They use EDI, specifically the ANSI standard for electronic bills of lading: ANSI X12 EDI 211 Motor Carrier Bill of Lading. You&#8217;d think IBM would be aware of that, what with them being a prime mover in the development of the EDI standards.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Once again, we have solutions in search of a problem.</p></div></aside></section>

<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Who owns the Mona Lisa?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>An outfit called Verisart, founded in 2015, applies "blockchain technology to combine transparency, anonymity, and security to protect your records of creation and ownership".</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This will, apparently, increase the trust in art dealers and reduce fraud, presumably because you can show the provenance of a piece. It&#8217;s another supply chain thing.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>But what if I see a fake and keep the original in my secret underground art gallery?</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/edent.jpg" alt="edent" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Terence Eden, senior GDS chap and general digital prankster, signed up with a pic of the Mona Lisa he&#8217;d grabbed from Wikipedia and, bish bosh, got a certificate of authenticity from Verisart.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Verisart, of course, argue that this isn&#8217;t the point, he deliberately mislead them, and so on.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The link is still live though
<a href="https://verisart.com/works/23f2c64a-08c6-4a42-8013-84ac8422dffb" class="bare">https://verisart.com/works/23f2c64a-08c6-4a42-8013-84ac8422dffb</a></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, I think it&#8217;s exactly the point. Blockchains can only "prove" the data on the chain.  This bit of data arrived at this time from this address. It can&#8217;t say anything about what happened to the data before that, it certainly can&#8217;t assert its truth, and it absolutely can&#8217;t tie a digital certificate to a real world object.</p></div></aside></section>

<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>I mean you&#8217;d have to be drunk to believe that.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is true for every scenario - you can&#8217;t tie something on the blockchain to a physical object.  You can&#8217;t tie it to a real event either.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/hr.png" alt="hr" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Blockchains will revolutionise HR, right, because we can have a complete and proper record of somebody&#8217;s qualifications and job history and so on.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>How do we verify that? I have a BSc in Electronic Engineering (Environmental and Ecological) from the University of Hull.  I got a 2:1 and I graduated in 1991.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>True, not true?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It&#8217;s not true, I got a 2:2.  How would you have confirmed that? Ask for my degree certificate? I don&#8217;t know where it is, and if I did produce something how would you know it was genuine? You&#8217;d have to back to the University and ask them right?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So, for a trustworthy piece of data to get onto the blockchain, I have to go to a trusted third party and ask them.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>What if such a third party doesn&#8217;t exist?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>And what if they get it wrong? How does that play with GDPR, for instance. Or with libel laws? What is the data itself is illegal?</p></div></aside></section>

<div class="paragraph"><p>There is no good here. Cryptocurrencies are a pile of shit, smart contracts are extremely difficult, the public blockchain is unreliable.  As technologists we&#8217;ve some right old rubbish come and go, but this stuff, this really is shit.</p></div></aside></section>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I want to, very quickly, describe Archangel, which is about the only blockchain application you&#8217;ll hear of that doesn&#8217;t immediately make you feel dirty.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Archangel is a collaboration between the University of Surrey CVSSP, The National Archives, and The Open Data Institute. It’s funded by Research Councils UK’s Digital Economy Programme through the EPSRC.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/tna.jpg" alt="tna" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Here&#8217;s the National Archive. They are the official archive of the UK Government and for England and Wales.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>All Government records are retained by the Archive, and it also has a statutory role in overseeing custody of some other public records. Because of its history - it’s existed in some form or another for hundreds of years - and the importance of the documents it retains, it has a leading role in archive policy, not just in Britain, but globally.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Organisations like TNA, and we can think of other examples in the UK like The Bodlian Library or around the world like The Library of Congress, use the term 'memory institution' (or AMI 'archival and memory institution'). They seem themselves as custodians of the country’s and the world’s history, and they take that extremely seriously. As you might imagine then, the people there are discomforted, at the very least, but the increasingly post-truth nature of public discourse.</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/chh-resignation-letter.jpg" alt="chh resignation letter" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>We live in a time where those in charge of important national institutions are actively undermining them. It&#8217;s not just Trump and his "Putin told me he didn&#8217;t do it, so don&#8217;t listen to the CIA, FBI, or NSA", it&#8217;s happening here too.  This is Chris Heaton-Harris' resignation letter in which he says</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>"It has been a privilege to work with some quite brilliant civil servants in my department &#8230;&#8203; They have moved mountation to prepare our country for leaving the EU with a negotiated deal. Unfortunately, I do not believe the briefings you have received on these matters have reflected all they have achieved or the preparation our European partners have made."</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This sounds to me like an accusation of dishonesty.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We&#8217;ve got a public discourse that is actively undermining the institutions of state.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Most AMIs operate some kind of delayed release. In this country Cabinet Office records are typically released after 20 years. But in twenty years, if we&#8217;ve constantly had our institutions diminished, why would people trust them? When they say "here are the records from such-and-such", it would be reasonable to say "but, that&#8217;s just a bunch pdfs and word docs you could pulled out of anywhere".</p></div></aside></section>
<section data-transition="none"><div class="imageblock" style=""><div class="content"><img src="images/OAIS.png" alt="OAIS" /></div></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>This is a quick overview of archival practice.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If we write the SIP to a blockchain, then when we produce the document how ever many years later we can show it is the same document that went in.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There&#8217;s an experiment running at the moment using a permissioned blockchain - so the people who can write are limited but anyone can read it - involving TNA, various other UK organisations, and archives in Australia, Norway, Estonia, and elsewhere.  Each archive is a part of the PoA mining clique. In essence, each archive is helping to underpin the others. If they did collaborate to tamper with the chain, their collective reputations are destroyed. So we&#8217;re not saying you don&#8217;t need a trusted third party, we&#8217;re saying there&#8217;s are trusted third parties and each extra one means you can trust it a bit more.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you think Trump or whomever is interfering with their institutions, you&#8217;d have to believe in a world-spanning conspiracy to think they can interfere with Norway, Australia, etc, etc.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s going to change the world. But it might just make it a bit better.</p></div></aside></section>
