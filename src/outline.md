What is a blockchain? 
* overview
* immutability
* consensus
  * PoW

Smart contracts

Well known examples - Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric
Less known examples - on 5 January 2018, coinmarketcap listed 2086 different cryptocurrencies and tokens

## Snake oil

Blockchains are all very clever, but basically they're slow databases. Yes, you can verify the database, but you need all of it in order to do so.

Cryptocurrencies? That list of 2086.  Number 23 was Tezos, with a valuation of $293,840,524 (down from $958 billion in August 2018 and ) In July 2017, Tezos raised $232 million in an "ICO". Note that's $232 million in ETH and BTC. The co-founders then immediately fell out, and there was a lot of legal wrangling.  The project now has a new head and has "converting assets out of cryptocurrencies".  The network itself is "in beta" with maybe 100 "bakers". 
Number 24 was Dogecoin at $270 million. "Dogecoin is an open source peer-to-peer digital currency, favored by Shiba Inus worldwide." It was created as a joke.

Most successful DApp?  Crypto Kitties.

Immutability is great, but it's also a problem. The only way to fix bugs or to upgrade capabilities is by "hard fork".

The situation is similar for smart contracts, but worse. How do you fix bugs in an unchangeable piece of code? How do you even debug the problem?

And what if the data is wrong?

Blockchains can only verify things which happen on the blockchain.
