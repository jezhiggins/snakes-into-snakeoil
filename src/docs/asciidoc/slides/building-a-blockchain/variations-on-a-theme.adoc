I've referred, so far, pretty much exclusively to Bitcoin. It was the first cryptocurrency, so it's the one most people have heard of, and it also set the template for what followed.

There are now somewhere north of 2000 cryptocurrencies. Creating a new one is easy! By definition all this code needs to be open source, so you just grab that, tweak it a tiny bit and off you go.

Or just goto http://build-a-co.in and fill in a form.

Other cryptocurrencies are broadly similar.  Often, these other cryptocurrencies are attempting to correct some perceived flaw in BitCoin, or the flaw in the one that corrected the perceived flaw ...

That's why some of these logos look similar to each other - they're forks of each other.

These other cryptocurrencies might differ in terms of block frequency - how often new blocks are created - or in block size - how much data we can stuff into one block - or in how block rewards are created. Some systems generate all the currency right up front, and just had it out.

One area where there's a lot of active work in the block creation mechanism.

The system I described a few moments ago is called proof-of-work. It achieves it's aim, but it's hugely wasteful.  In a proof-of-work system, the chance of you mining the new block are proportional to your *hashpower* compared to the hashpower of the whole network.

In a proof-of-stake network, you pay a stake for the chance to create a new block. You chance then become linked to the size of your stake. There's an interesting bootstrapping problem here, of course, and you'd need protections to prevent the whole system getting hijacked, but it's an active area of development.

Proof-of-authority doesn't rely on either of these mechanisms. Instead, you define a limited number of nodes and say "one of you can mine the next block". Then you can turn the difficulty on your hash function right down.  Proof-of-authority flies in the face of the "no central authority" thing, but for many applications that probably not an issue and probably a benefit.

The other major way some of these platforms differ is in what can go into a transaction.

One of the consistent themes of the talk so far is me holding back information to spring on you at a later point.  I'm going to do it again.

I've blithely talked about transactions saying person A sends some bitcoin to person B, and made it sound like that's a little data structure or something. That's not quite the case - the transaction is actually a little script.

Here's an example - we've got a metadata header at the top - number in inputs, number of outputs, and the hash of the entire transaction.

Then we have the input section. An input specifies a previous transaction, so we have the hash of that transaction, and the index of the output we're claiming.

Then we have the outputs - in this case only one although their can be many.  The output has a value, and the sum of the output has to be equal or less than the sum of the inputs. If it's less, the difference is the transaction fee. Then there's this weird line here - this is a BitCoin script.

The scripting language in Bitcoin is pretty basic - its not Turing complete, for instance - and it's not clear to me that much is done with it beyond the send some money to person B.

This little bit of script here is saying, in effect, the output of this script can be redeemed by a public key that hashes to 69e02whatever, along with a value signature from the owner of that key".

There are two possible outcomes from one of these scripts - it works, in which case the transaction is valid - or it doesn't, in which case it will be discarded.  There are about 160 opcodes in the Bitcoin script language, but these 4 in this order are the most common by far.

Some blockchains go beyond simple scripting into something much broader, into what we call smart contracts.  Ethereum is the probably best the known cryptocurrency example.  You might also have heard of Hyperledger Fabric.

Now we all know that naming things in Computer Science is hard. However, in this particular case, the naming is deliberately obfuscatory. A smart contract is not smart, nor is it a contract. It's a program you can deploy into your blockchain.

The programs expose various public methods, and calls to those methods can form one of the transactions encoded into each block. When your client downloads and validates a block, it runs any smart contract method calls in the block. So a smart contract is way of asking other people to perform computation on your behalf.

Now this sounds like a one-way trip to Denial-of-service city. The mechanism to prevent that is, you'll be unsurprised to learn, financial.  Each opcode has a cost associated with it, and to run the method your transaction is actually "call this method with these parameters and I will pay this amount".  If you don't pay enough, it doesn't run but you've spent it anyway. Ethereum also incorporates a computational limit on each block, so there's an upper-bound on it.
