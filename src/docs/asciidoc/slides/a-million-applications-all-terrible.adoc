Programming? Easy or hard?

Writing a program and getting right first time and never, ever being able to change it? Easy or hard?

Smart contracts are extremely difficult to write correctly and kind of impossible to fix if they're broken. Naming things is acknowledged as a hard problem. Here, smart contract is a deliberate misnomer. The idea, the goal, is to replace legal contracts with nice precise accurate computer code. What could go wrong?

Parity's multi-sig wallet smart contract had a bug that allowed an attacker to take ownership of a wallet and drain the funds.  There was a huge amount stolen. The only reason more wasn't stolen was a because a "white-hat" nipped in and drained the remain wallets (that's a 51% attack!) and then gave the money back.

Phew. They issued an update. That means they deployed a new version of the contract, and have to tell everyone don't use that one, use this new one.

Then another bug allowed someone to take control of a library contract the multi-sig wallet was using and kill it.

The Parity multi-sig wallet was written in Solidity - that I showed a sample of earlier. The head of Parity designed Solidity.

But smart contracts? There must be some advantage in being able to express things in clear, unabiguous language right?

Which party will control the House after the 2018 U.S. Midterm Election?

That's pretty clear, right? You'd be able to answer that question unambiguously.  Augur is a predication marketplace running on Ethereum. Last year, a market on this question was opened.

The market expiration date was 12 Oct 2018. The Democrats didn't officially take control until 3 Jan 2019, so one could argue the Republicans is the correct outcome - they controlled the house when the market closed.

One could argue and one has been.  The code is law camp argues "Republican" is the right answer, but people on the other side say "whoa, obviously the Dems won".

Augur includes a dispute mechanism, which is now in its 6th round.  In order to trigger a dispute, you have to put up a bond. For each round the size of the bond gets bigger. There was already $700k tied up in market.  I tried to find out if the situation had resolved one way or the other, but I think it's stalled.

Computer says no.

Crytokitties is a game in which players purchase, collect, breed and sell various types of virtual cats. Collectors cards, basically.

As of December 5, 2017 Etherscan has reported a sixfold increase in pending transactions on Ethereum since the game's release just a week earlier. "CryptoKitties has become so popular that it's taking up a significant amount of available space for transactions on the Ethereum platform", said Garrick Hileman, from the University of Cambridge.[19] Ethereum miners increased the gas limit in response to CryptoKitties, which allowed for more data per block and increasing transactions per second.

"I'm sorry we didn't get that report done on time. There was this new cat-breeding game tying up all the network resources."

Blockchains will revolutionize, well, everything. Those adverts told us so!

Saays "report inappropriate predictions", hmm.

Supply chain - let's take that. It's often talked about, including as a "solution" to the rather vexed question of the post-Brexit Irish border problem.

Here's an news item from earlier this year. IBM and Pacific International Lines conducted a trial on a blockchain powered bill of lading. The bill of lading is the manifest of your goods being shipped, in this case 3000 cartons of mandarin oranges shipped from China to Singapore.

"With the use of IBM Blockchain powered e-BL, the trial has produced a significant reduction in the administrative process of transferring the title deed from five to seven days to just one second, claimed the parties."

This article goes on to talk about how it's important fresh produce is moved quickly, and how you get cost savng because you don't have to refridgerate it for so long, and all the rest of it.

Does anyone else smell anything?

This five to seven days refers to paper based bills of lading, which nobody's used for 30 years on account of them all being modern and electronic. They use EDI, specifically the ANSI standard for electronic bills of lading: ANSI X12 EDI 211 Motor Carrier Bill of Lading. You'd think IBM would be aware of that, what with being a prime mover in the development of the EDI standards.

Once again, we have solutions in search of a problem.

Who owns the Mona Lisa?

An outfit called Verisart, founded in 2015, applies "blockchain technology to combine transparency, anonymity, and security to protect your records of creation and ownership".

This will, apparently, increase the trust in art dealers and reduce fraud, presumably because you can show the provenance of a piece. It's another supply chain thing.

But what if I see a fake and keep the original in my secret underground art gallery?

Terence Eden, senior GDS chap and general digital prankster, signed up with a pic of the Mona Lisa he'd grabbed from Wikipedia and, bish bosh, got a certificate of authenticity from Verisart.

Verisart, of course, argue that this isn't the point, he deliberately mislead them, and so on.

However, I think it's exactly the point. Blockchains can only "prove" the data on the chain.  This bit of data arrived at this time from this address. It can't say anything about what happened to the data before that, it certainly assert its truth, and it absolutely can't tie a digital certificate to a real world object.

I mean you'd have to be drunk to believe that.

This is true for every scenario - you can't tie something on the blockchain to a physical object.  You can't tie it to a real event either.

Blockchains will revolutionise HR, right, because we can have a complete and proper record of somebody's qualifications and job history and so on.

How do we verify that? I have a BSc in Electronic Engineering (Environmental and Ecological) from the University of Hull.  I got a 2:1 and I graduated in 1991.

True, not true?

It's not true, I got a 2:2.  How would you have confirmed that? Ask for my degree certificate? I don't know where it is, and if I did produce something how would you know it was genuine? You'd have to back to the University and ask them right?

So, for a trustworthy piece of data to get onto the blockchain, I have to go to a trusted third party and ask them.

What if such a third party doesn't exist?

And what if they get it wrong? How does that play with GDPR, for instance. Or with libel laws? What is the data itself is illegal?

There is no good here. Cryptocurrencies are a pile of shit, smart contracts are extremely difficult, the public blockchain is unreliable. If I want a tamper-proof ledger, we've known how to do that for 40 years.
