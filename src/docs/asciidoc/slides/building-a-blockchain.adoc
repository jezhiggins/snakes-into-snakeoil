A linked list - a singly linked list - it doesn't get much simpler than that.

Start at the head, traverse the pointers, add things onto the end. Easy-peasy.

OK, so first we're going to traverse the list in the other direction ...

Generally, of course, when we talk about a linked list, it's all in memory right, so these are pointers to chunks to chunks of memory.
