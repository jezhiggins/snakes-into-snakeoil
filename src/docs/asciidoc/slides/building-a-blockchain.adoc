Does that all make reasonable sense?

Hopefully there's enough detail there for you to see how it all hangs together. I didn't want to get hung up on the precise details of hash function implementations or the ins-and-outs of the peer-to-peer protocol or anything like that, because it's not that important and would only get in the way.

OK.
